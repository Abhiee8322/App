# Project on credit card loan defualt prediction in which the model predicts whether the person would default his loan or not.
## In this project I have carried out following tasks.
## Data collection: Collected the relevant data from kaggle
## Data exploration: Explored the data to see the presence of outliers and null values.
## Data vizualization: Vizualized the raw data to see any inherent trends and measures.
## Data cleaning: Clean the data by treating null values and outliers.
## Data modelling: Modeled the data using various ML algorithms.
## Data validation: Validated the model using unseen data.
## Model Deployment: Deployed the model on the web using streamlit library and heroku platform.
